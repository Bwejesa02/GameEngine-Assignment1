AJ's github account will be seen as uploading most of the work as he is the one who performed the copy-paste from our GDW repo to this repo to start.

We are using our GDW project Bumper Brawl, a party game where players controlling cars will brawl in a sumo-style to push each other out of safe zones which decrease in size and change location every 30 seconds to score points.

We implemented a basic player controller/input manager Blueprint as a singleton and a timer manager via an actor component Blueprint with a UI element as our second singleton.
